# Campus Pulse: A Web App for Finding Roommates and Campus Events

Campus Pulse is a web-based application designed to enhance university student engagement by helping them find compatible roommates and discover campus events. Built using the principles of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, this project aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for university students, fostering a sense of community and connection.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of Campus Pulse was to apply the principles of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** to design and develop an application that prioritizes usability, accessibility, and engagement. Through iterative prototyping, user-centered design, and thorough evaluations, we aimed to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform.

## Features

- **Roommate Finder**: Match with compatible roommates based on lifestyle preferences and values.
- **Event Discovery**: Explore and register for campus events, from academic workshops to social gatherings.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Receive tailored suggestions for roommates and events based on user preferences.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Get reminders for upcoming events and updates on your profile.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Fully compliant with accessibility standards, including WAVE, Colorblindly, and usability principles.
- **User-friendly Design**: Intuitive navigation and visually appealing interface to boost engagement.

## HCI Principles and Design Process

### 1. **User-Centered Design**
- **Persona Building**: Developed detailed personas representing different user types (e.g., international students, local students) to ensure the app met diverse needs.
- **User Stories**: Created user stories to define functionalities, e.g., *"As a student, I want to search for compatible roommates so that I can find someone with similar interests and habits."*

### 2. **Prototyping**
- **Low-Fidelity Prototype**: Developed hand-drawn sketches to outline basic layouts and flows.
- **Mid-Fidelity Prototype**: Used **Figma** to create interactive wireframes with more detailed designs.
- **High-Fidelity Prototype**: Designed pixel-perfect, interactive prototypes with all UI elements.
- Each prototyping stage incorporated user feedback, leading to refinements in layout, navigation, and feature placement.

### 3. **HCI Principles Applied**
- **Laws of Simplicity**: Ensured minimal cognitive load by decluttering interfaces and focusing on essential elements.
- **Tidwell Patterns**: Applied proven UI design patterns for consistency and usability.
- **Nielsen‚Äôs Heuristic Evaluation**: Evaluated prototypes against Nielsen's heuristics (e.g., visibility of system status, user control, and error prevention).

### 4. **Early Storyboarding**
- Created early storyboards to map user journeys and identify potential pain points, which informed the app's core functionalities.

### 5. **Usability Testing**
- Conducted usability testing during each prototype stage to identify and resolve issues related to navigation, readability, and functionality.
- **Engagement**: Focused on improving engagement by refining features like real-time notifications, roommate recommendations, and event filters.

### 6. **Accessibility Review**
- Evaluated the app's accessibility using:
  - **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)**: Automated checks for WCAG compliance.
  - **Colorblindly**: Manual testing for colorblindness simulations.
  - **IBM Accessibility Checker**: Ensured adherence to accessibility guidelines for universal usability.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For a scalable and efficient backend.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based database solution.

### Frontend
- **React**: For building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Figma**: Used for prototyping and user interface design.
